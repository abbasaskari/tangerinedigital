Hi there. </br>
</br>
I implemented a backend applications to store and retrieve product data. You can perform CRUD on product. That means application get product information and generate unique productId. ater that you can update and delete product. </br>
You can send your request throuth https://domain/springresttest/prid/1 and fetch one product.</br>
Also ou can send your request throuth https://domain/springresttest/prids and fetch all products.</br>
Rest Controller have security implementation. User name is: user1 and password is: user1Pass</br>
I have implemented Logs in this application.</br>
This application is implemented with Java 17 on Springboot framework version 2.7.7. I used sonarqube for inspect my code and check the quality of it. I used spring-boot-starter-data-jpa dependency for connecting to database and store and manage objects on it. Used database is h2, that is the in-memory database. The build tool used is Gradle version 7.4.2.</br>
</br>
